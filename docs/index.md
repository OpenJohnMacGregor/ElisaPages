### Linux Architecture

Different members of the Architecture WG seem to use the term "architecture" in a number of
imprecise and unclear ways.
Paul Albertella started an e-mail thread on the term, to which Chris Temple provided a link to
the IEE general defintion of "architecture".
I decided to apply that definition to Linux to provide a basis for discussions in the Architecture WG.
Hopefully we'll ultimately arrive at a common understanding of the architectures (system, software and Linux)
that our project addresses.
This in turn could be useful throughout the project.
The Ontology WG should then adopt and maintain it.

### White Paper

The original ELISA white paper was written in LaTex and was stored on the [ELISA White Papers GitHub site](https://github.com/elisa-tech/ELISA-White-Papers).
Ultimately, in the Brussels workshop, we established that the document was intended for onboarding 
new project participants rather than acquiring them.
There hasn't been much work done on it and it is pretty much in the state in which it was written.
I made a proposal to the TSC and the Ambassadors WG to start an ELISA onboarding website,
which ultimately resulted in a [presentation at the 7th Workshop](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vboV7gR2yHJELlaXoIPf6HMaBrke94WQ).
In anticipation of the Onboarding Website, I translated the White Paper document to markdown to provide a basis for discussion.

### Pseudo-DIA

Lukas Bulwahn proposed defining a "Pseudo-DIA" way back in April 2020.
After digesting the proposal for a while, I wrote a review of the concept in a series of e-mails.
Activity on the subject basically ended in June 2020, 
and the idea has lain dormant ever since.
But, lo and behold the topic came up in a recent conversation with an ELISA colleague
who was thinking about working on a DIA-related topic.

I decided to throw the gist of the e-mails into a markdown document and post it here as a common basis for discussion.
Lukas has now suggested that we round of the work and bring it in form for a wider audience.
Don't be surprised if you're approached for a review.
