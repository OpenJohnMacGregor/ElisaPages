This is a private site to store discussion documents, mostly for the ELISA Ontology task force.

## Contents

### Linux Architecture

I created a definition of Linux' architecture to provide a basis for discussions in the Architecture WG.
Ultimately, it could be useful throughout the project.
The Ontology WG should then adopt and maintain it.

### White Paper

The original ELISA white paper was written in LaTex and was stored on the [ELISA White Papers GitHub site](https://github.com/elisa-tech/ELISA-White-Papers).
Ultimately, in the Brussels workshop, we established that the document was intended for onboarding 
new project participants rather than acquiring them.
There hasn't been much work done on it and it is pretty much in the state in which it was written.
I made a proposal to the TSC and the Ambassadors WG to start an ELISA onboarding website,
which ultimately resulted in a [presentation at the 7th Workshop](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vboV7gR2yHJELlaXoIPf6HMaBrke94WQ).
In anticipation of the Onboarding Website, I translated the White Paper document to markdown to provide a basis for discussion.
